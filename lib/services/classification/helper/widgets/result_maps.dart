      'Flower development (pre-anthesis): Scales separate and pale yellow to white petals begin to unfold over 3–5 days.',
  'stage-3':
      'Full bloom (anthesis): Canopy is covered with open panicles for 1–2 days—peak pollination period.',

  'stage-3':
      'Maintain consistent soil moisture during full bloom to support pollination and reduce flower drop.',
